## FAQ

**Q**: Do the exchange rates on this application fluctuate? 

**A**: No, the exchange rates on TrackStars are hardcoded into the programme. One of the key requirements of this project is that it must be able to run  offline. Hence, live updates of 
exchange rates are difficult to implement. We have taken the latest exchange rates as of 27 October 2025.

**Q** Can I attach my bank account or transactions to any currency I want?

**A** No, TrackStars only has a limited number of currencies. In the spirit of narrowing down the scope of our targeted user, we decided to implement
currencies of popular travel destinations in South East Asia. The following currencies are available: Thai Baht (BHT), Vietnamese Dong (VND), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Singapore Dollar (SGD) and Japanese Yen (JPY).
Japan is not a South East Asian country, but is included since it is such a popular travel destination.

**Q** Can the parameters of a command be input in any order?

**A** No, the parameters of the commands must be input in the specific order that the User Guide mentions.

**Q** When keying in transactions, must the dates be in the format dd/mm? 

**A** Yes, the dates must be in that specific format (dd/mm). The programme is not able to convert 10 January to 10/1/.

**Q** Why can't I input the year in my transactions? Why am I relegated to only transactions in the current year?

**A** This is a reasonable question, but consider the targeted user of TrackStars. TrackStars aims to serve NUS Exchangers to aggregate financial data into a single application. The NUS academic semester is from either August - December (Sem 1) or January - May (sem 2). As such, it seemed redundant to the developers to include a year, as NUS Exchangers stay at NUS for at most, 6 months, and that stint never crosses into a new year. Meaning, it is expected that if an NUS exchanger partakes in an exchange programme in 2025, they will leave by 2025.
